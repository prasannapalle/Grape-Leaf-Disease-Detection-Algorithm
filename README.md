# Grape-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Algorithm
Grapes are the essential crop in todayâ€™s
world. In order to maintain a good crop yield of
grapes, farmers need to protect them from many
diseases and some of the common diseases are black
measles, black rot and leaf blight. As grapes are
vulnerable to these diseases, they should be taken
care in early stages. Our project is based on
developing machine learning models to detect and
classify grape diseases, so that farmers can easily
identify the type of disease and take appropriate
measures. For this grape disease and classification,
we designed four different machine learning models
which are powerful enough to accurately predict the
type of disease. The four models are, CNN, VGG16
CNN(Advanced CNN), Random Forest Model,
Support Vector Machine. For the purpose of
training the models and data preprocessing, a
dataset is collected from different sources and fed
to the models. We have also developed a web
application, where the user can give an image of a
grape leaf to detect if it is affected by disease and
additionally classifies the disease with the accuracy
score.
